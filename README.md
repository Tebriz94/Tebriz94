# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m a DevOps engineer who enjoys solving infrastructure challenges with code. I like clean pipelines, well-documented systems, and tools that just work. When I’m not automating deployments or tuning Kubernetes clusters, I’m probably exploring new tools or contributing to side projects.

Let’s build things that don’t break on Fridays 🚀
