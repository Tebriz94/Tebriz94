# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer who enjoys solving infrastructure challenges with code. I like clean pipelines, well-documented systems, and tools that just work. When Iâ€™m not automating deployments or tuning Kubernetes clusters, Iâ€™m probably exploring new tools or contributing to side projects.

Letâ€™s build things that donâ€™t break on Fridays ðŸš€
